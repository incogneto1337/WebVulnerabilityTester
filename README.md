# WebVulnerabilityTester

## Overview

The Web Vulnerability Tester is a Python script designed for testing web applications for common vulnerabilities. It includes functionalities to test for XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities, integrates with advanced tools like SQLMap and OWASP ZAP, and generates vulnerability reports. This tool is intended for educational purposes and ethical hacking.

## Features

- **XSS Testing:** Detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities using various payloads.
- **SQL Injection Testing:** Check for SQL Injection vulnerabilities with multiple payloads.
- **SQLMap Integration:** Automate SQL Injection testing with SQLMap.
- **OWASP ZAP Integration:** Perform comprehensive security scans using OWASP ZAP.
- **Report Generation:** Create detailed vulnerability reports in PDF format.
- **Logging:** Log all actions and results for review and debugging.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- **Requests Library**: Install via `pip install requests`.
- **SQLMap**: Download and install from [SQLMap's official website](https://sqlmap.org/).
- **OWASP ZAP**: Download and install from [OWASP ZAP's official website](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/).
- **ReportLab Library**: Install via `pip install reportlab`.
- **python-owasp-zap-v2.4 Library**: Install via `pip install python-owasp-zap-v2.4`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/WebVulnerabilityTester.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd WebVulnerabilityTester
    ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install requests reportlab python-owasp-zap-v2.4
    ```

4. Ensure SQLMap and OWASP ZAP are installed and accessible from your command line.

## Configuration

1. **OWASP ZAP API Key:**
   Update the `run_zap` function in the script with your OWASP ZAP API key.

    ```python
    zap = ZAPv2(apikey='your_zap_api_key')  # Replace with your ZAP API key
    ```

2. **SQLMap Path:**
   Ensure that `sqlmap` is accessible from your command line. If not, provide the full path to `sqlmap` in the `run_sqlmap` function.

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python web_vuln_tester.py
```

### Menu Options

1. **Test XSS**: Test for XSS vulnerabilities using predefined payloads.
2. **Test SQL Injection**: Check for SQL Injection vulnerabilities with various payloads.
3. **Run SQLMap**: Perform an automated SQL Injection scan using SQLMap.
4. **Run OWASP ZAP**: Execute a comprehensive security scan using OWASP ZAP.

Follow the prompts to select the type of test and enter the target URL.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Web Vulnerability Tester
1. Test XSS
2. Test SQL Injection
3. Run SQLMap
4. Run OWASP ZAP
Choose an option (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter the URL of the form to test: http://example.com/form
Testing XSS on http://example.com/form
XSS vulnerability detected with payload: <script>alert("XSS")</script>
```

## Report Generation

After running tests, a PDF report named `vulnerability_report.pdf` will be generated in the script's directory, detailing the vulnerabilities found.
